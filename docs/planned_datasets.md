1. Already done
2. All modifications:
   1. Clache clip from range 1, 3, 5, size 4, 12, 20
   2. Gamma Correction 0.6 - 1.4
   3. Gaussian blur 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15
   4. Gaussian noise 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6 (1.4, 1.6 is strong)
   5. Maybe poisson noise
   6. Histogram equalization
   7. Median filter 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 (from 11 effect is strong & use if poisson noise is used as well) 
   8. Red eye effect
3. Maybe it would be worth to exclude some modifications?
4. Prepare special test sets, e.g. full gamma correction, values from same range as dataset (more data to prepare diagrams etc.)
